# HTML & CSS - Travel Site Using Materialize CSS 1.0 Framework

### About

Utilizing the powerfully robust Materialize CSS framework, we created this beautiful mock travel agency website for "Travelite".

I was particularly impressed with the ease, flexibility and power of this particular CSS framework when compared to the likes of Bootstrap, Bulma and W3.
